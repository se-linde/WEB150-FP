<h1>About</h1>    

<p>Dwayne Linde dreamed up his tea shoppe when living in a vegan anarchist co-op in the outskirts of Medina, WA. He grew up, like most Americans, drinking coffee. Tea was never consumed, except for limpid glasses of Lipton's he'd get served in diners. Until he was 19, he thought all tea was like this. Weak leaf juice. Coffee was his main drink whilst he pursued a Botany degree that he didn't really have his heart into. </p>

<p>Then a touring agit-punk band from Gold Bar came and crashed in the living room, stuck there for a week because their squat flooded. Every morning, the bassist - a skinny lady named Rayne with bleached hair, 8 piercings, and a questionable taste in footwear - would plod into the kitchen, boil some water, and ration out a teaspoon of what looked like dried out leaves from a hand sewn silk bag, with scientific precision. One morning, she made Dwayne a cup, and for the first time, he tasted real tea. Rich and malty, with notes of chocolate and tangerines and smoke. He asked the bassist what this was, and she shrugged, and said 'Irish Breakfast. Mainly an Assam, but with some Ceylon thrown in to lighten it up. Got the tea from a small shop in Belfast last year. Wish I could get this easily here in Puget Sound!'. Dwayne wished for the same, now that he found a new purpose to his life - to bring this rich, delicious tea to everyone else.</p>

<p>Rayne and Dwayne put their heads and resources together, and decided to tr to import some tea from Belfast, and repackage it for resale in Seattle. They couldn't find a distributor to work with in Northern Ireland, but one in London agreed. Rayne stayed behind in the co-op, and the two formed a small mail-order shop out of their bedrooms. </p>
    
<p>Rayne unexpectly had to move to Chicago, leaving Dwayne the sole owner of the shop. He found an abandoned pho shop in Othello, and he opened a store there. Since then, Lord Dwayne's Tea Shoppe has been supplying the greater Puget Sound area with the finest of teas and tisanes, imported from the UK.</p>
