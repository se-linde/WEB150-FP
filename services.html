<p><h3 class="tea">Black Teas</h3>
<p>We stock only the finest black teas that we get from India and China. The <i>Camellia sinensis</i> plant is the source of the tea, and of all the teas, black tea is fermented the longest. Careful brewing is required, otherwise the brew can turn astringent. Some varieties, like the Assam, goes well with milk and/or sugar. </p>    
    
<p>We stock both loose leaf and bagged black teas, of the following kinds: Darjeeling, Assam, Keemun, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Scottish Breakfast, Builder's Tea.</p>

<div id="green" class="tea">
<p><h3 class="tea">Green Teas</h3>    
<p>green tea is made from the same plant, but is unfermented. Thus, it is the most delicate of the teas that we sell. Optimum brewing temperature is a few degrees below boiling, and only needs to be brewed for a minute or two. Best served b itself, the leaves can handle up to 5-6 steepings.</p>
    
<p>We stock all sorts of teas, both loose leaf and bagged, from Japan and South Korea: Sencha, Genmaicha, Hojicha. We also sell exquisite cast iron teapots, perfect for brewing green tea.</p>

<div id="oolong" class="tea">
<h3 class="tea">Oolong Teas</h3>    
    
<p>Oolong is that happy balance between black and green tea. Lightly fermented, it can handle water that is just below boiling, and multiple steepings.</p> 
    
<p>We sell many different oolongs from the Fújiàn province, as well as from Taiwan. We also sell Yixing clay cups and pots, which work well for brewing and serving oolong tea.</p>
